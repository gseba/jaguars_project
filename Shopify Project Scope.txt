Hypothesis: The majority of traffic and sales come from customers that already recognize the brand, and 
	    MENU is not reaching out to new customers.

Null Hypothesis: The majority of traffic and sales do not come from customers that already recognize the 
		 brand, and MENU is reaching out to new customers.



--- Research Questions to Answers ---

1. Market segmentation
	- Graph 1: Age/gender
	- Graph 2: Sessions, transactions, conversions
	- Graph 3: bounce rate, pages per sessions, avg session duration

2. What variables/factors are associated to a purchase/conversion?
	Graph 1: E-commerce conversion channels
	Graph 2: Get more in depth on Referrals and Organic searches
	Graph 3: Order of conversion channels - referral, direct, paid search, email etc.

3. what proportion of traffic that comes from organic searches are from users that already know the brand
and what proportion comes from generic searches (indicative of SEO)?
	Graph 1:  Organic Searches/queries showing what terms 
	Graph 2:  Show the benchmark sessions 

4. Does the landing page correlate to actual sales/ purchases?
	Graph 1: The types of landing pages
	Graph 2: Bounce rate and sales based on landing page

Recommendations: 
- Even though MENU represents a niche market, we still believe MENU is only capturing a small portion of
	a small market and there's room for them to gain new customers.
