--- Rough Breakdown of Tasks ---

Angeles -searches --> Shopify / Plan of Action
Jonah - segmentation
Ghassan - Searches & conversion rate of landing pages

Documentation indexes:
destination_location: customer location
gateway: shopify_payments --> their layaway so cart is partially paid
buyer_accepts_marketing


- segmentations: destination location - zip code - where are people purchasing from
 		from?
			- Gender, age, income (if possible), zip/location
			- find the demographic with the highest conversion rate and focus on
			  marketing to this group
			- 
- Searches/queries: 
	- how many people searched for MENU? (organic searches)
		- main keyword searches by [returning] customers
		- 
	- how many people got to MENU NA through another site or search terms?
		- indicative of SEO

Hypothesis: The majority of traffic and sales come from customers that already recognize the brand, and 
	    MENU is not reaching out to new customers.
